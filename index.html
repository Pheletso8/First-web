            <h2 class="heading">About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <p>I was born and bred in Soweto where I completed my high school education at a school called Meadowlands secondary School.
            I then enrolled at the University of the Witwatersrand to pursue a general BSc where I majored in Chemistry and Applied Chemistry, completed in 2022.
            following the completion of my undergraduate degree, I enrolled in the BSc hons Chemistry program where I completed the four 
            traditional topics in chemistry which are Organic, Inorganic, Physical and Analytical Chemistry. There are two projects which you have to complete in order to
            obtain the postgraduate degree, whats interesting is that there are also contemporary topics in chemistry which you also have to complete apart from the four traditional topics, my love for 
            AI begun in one particular contemporary topic called the applications of AI in Chemistry which inspired the transition to Data Science. The following year after completing my honours degree I transitioned into a Postgraduate Diploma in Data Science 
            at the same University where I studied the Maths and stats foundations of data science, the principles of machine learning and the applications of machine learning. The theory was then applied to different industries 
            like finance and healthcare where small research projects where completed. 

            Outside of school I am a very sport loving person. interested in most sport codes, and have tried out a few different sports. I particularly enjoy swimming and playing futsal, which is a particular indoor sport which draws similarities with football.
            I really hope this gives you some form of insight into the type of person that I am. 
            Thanks for visiting bye!!

                    <p>A cutting-edge hybrid technique addressing the shortcomings and constraints of traditional pressure-driven
                        membrane procedures that handle highly concentrated solutions is membrane distillation crystallization (MDC). In the
                        study, sugar water was treated with the MDC technique to recover high-quality water and sugar crystals with uniform sizes
                        and good crystal growth. The effect of temperature on the permeate water flux, growth and morphology, and particle size
                        distribution was investigated by varying the feed temperatures.</p>

                    <h3>Metal-tetraporphyrazine intercalated Mxene as electrocatalyst for oxygen
                        reduction and evolution</h3>
                    <p>Fossil fuels, the primary energy source for decades, contribute significantly to environmental pollution and climate change, driving the need for sustainable alternatives and efficient energy storage solutions. 
                        Renewable sources like solar and wind face intermittency challenges, exacerbating grid instability and highlighting the importance of technologies such as rechargeable zinc-air batteries (RZABs). 
                        These batteries rely on oxygen electrocatalysis—oxygen reduction (ORR) during discharge and oxygen evolution (OER) during charge—but suffer from sluggish kinetics and high overpotentials. 
                        Current platinum-based catalysts are costly and unstable, prompting exploration of affordable alternatives. This study investigates Fe- and Co-metallotetraporphyrazines intercalated into MXenes (Ti2CTx), leveraging their stable MN4 active sites, conductivity, and corrosion resistance to enhance ORR/OER efficiency. 
                        The composite's performance was evaluated via physicochemical characterization (UV-Vis, XRD, SEM) and electrochemical tests (CV, LSV, EIS, RDE), aiming to advance cost-effective, durable catalysts for next-generation energy storage systems.</p>
